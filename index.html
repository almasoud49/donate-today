        <p>I first lost my house in the floodwater and then the house we took shelter in was flooded. We are now barely surviving.</p>
        <p>There are many villages in the upazila where no government and private relief reached. Hundreds of local youths are working round the clock with the help of solvent people, but we have barely reached 10 percent of the flood victims due to lack of proper fund.</p>
